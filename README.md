# Iris_Qiu_Final_Project
# Overview
Hi, welcome to my project! This project is a data analysis of spills happened in California from 2010 to 2023 by using Python Jupyter Notebook. 

During the interviews with Richmond residents, I found out that the refinery has a great impact on their lives. Many residents said that they were born with asthma and have witnessed many flaring events. Also, according to the Richmond Environment and Asthma Community Health (REACH) Study done by UCSF, the asthma rates in Richmond are nearly twice as high as in California. Thus, I would like to explore the trend of spills happened throught out the decades and its comparison between Richmond and other cities in California.

The data is obtained from the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services.
